## Overview
A project to help count Calories. Factors which affect Calorie needs are gender, age, height, weight, activity level and weight goal. These meal plans are written dynamically for someone who is male, 6'3" and 160 lbs. No. 1 meal plans added together make 2,700 Calories / Day.

Meal plans are a simple way to count Calories without overthinking. These meal plans are made with a budget in mind. **Weekly costs budget $100 and 2 hours cooking**.
